Make a program that calculates a standarzied weight.

* Standardized weight: weight based upon individual's height

Formula by gender:
    Male: height(m) x height(m) x 22
    Female : height(m) x height(m) x 21

Rule 1: standardized weight needs to be calculated in a function/def    
    * def name : std_weight
    * parameter : height, gender 
Rule 2: standardized weight needs to reflect up to the 100th decimal point

Example: 
You are a "gender", your height is "height", and your standardized weight is 67.38kg.
